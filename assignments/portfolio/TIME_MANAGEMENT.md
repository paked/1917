# Time/Project Management by Harrison Shoebridge
I always try to complete the activities to the best of my ability, in the neatest way possible. I was mostly on time with my programming tasks (apart from the period when I was on camp). I tracked my progress with a git repository located at http://github.com/paked/1917, every week I went back over my progress and looked over my development while making notes on what I could improve in. There were parts were I got completely lost in (re: frames) but I managed to get over that with the help of some tutors!

I always got my lectures watched on time. This was great as I could walk into a tutorial confident that I knew everything that I needed to know in order to complete the tasks at hand. During camp I didnt watch lectures, and the week we got back was highly painful in terms of hours spent in front of a computer listening to Richard Bucklands voice sped up at 200%.

For Game.c we took pride in submitting everything on time, always. We each put in a few hours a week fixing code and examining bugs/reviewing tests. Unfortunately I wasn didnt play too much of a role during the development of the Game as I was on camp. Using githubs built in tools we were able to allocated bugs and quickly discuss issues within the code... The inline commiting was a feature which was much abused. We made sure to have a checklist of tasks which could be completed at any point by bored members of the team.

Throughout the project we spent time on reflecting upon our code. One of the most painstaking decisions for us as a team was choosing our method of representing the map. We ended up going with an Edge/Vertice model proposed by Simon. 

During my time at HS1917 I was never late for a tutorial, apart from when I had to go watch Les Miserables with the rest of my music class. I take pride in being punctual to this kind of thing, and thus was not disappointed in my performance in this field.

We used our time effectively to conduct code reviews while we were working on projects. Team members would spend a few seconds every time a commit was made quickly going over code and making sure it wasnt *completely* insane.

During the course we always submitted our assignments on time, be they Game (already stated) or doomsday and Mandelbrot.

In the future I hope to be able to focus more, as it is perhaps my biggest downfall as a worker. It has greatly hindered my ability to correctly manage my time, that and my procrastinational abilities.
