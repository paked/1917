# Something Awesome - by Harrison Shoebridge
My something awesome project has gone through a variety of stages. Originally I thought I would be a build of my "code review site" over at http://github.com/paked/gerrycode, but this turned out not to be the case. One day I got rather bored and decided it would be fun to create a social experiment for my something awesome... So here it is: NUMBERS FOR PICTURES. A system for figuring out which numbers describe a picture. It was built using Go for the backend and AngularJS + Bootstrap for the frontend. The code was not particularly challenging, but I found it interesting brainstorming the idea.

I built this project to test my Entrepreneurship and Overcoming Procrastination skills.

It is available live at http://numbers.harrisonshoebridge.me
