While I was in a team I tried to help as much as possible. During the doomsday assignment, I helped my brain. During Mandelbrot I helped Julia[n]. During Game.c I helped Simon, Julia[n] and James.

In Mandelbrot I wrote a significant portion of the HTTP parts with routing while fixing bugs and writing a few colour algorithms. Julian took on the complex numbers things and we made quite a good team, whenever he had an issue he would ask me and whenever I had an issue I would ask him! We were able to fix all our issues and submit code on time.

In our pairwork I was originally teamed up with James. We worked well as a pair and our ability to work quickly while staying on top of due dates was awesome. I like to think that the code I wrote was some of the best I created in this course. Julia[n] and I did a fair amount of work together on the projects and subsequently had a lot of fun together while solving problems. I will forever remember the smell of cygwin radiating off of his computer.

I am not the most sociable person ever when it comes to strangers, I find it hard to get out their sometimes... But I tried really hard to contribute to a discussion or help out someone struggling if I had a chance to.

During the creating of Game we had a lot of situations where we would congratulate others on coming up with smart solutions to problems, or finding issues that we had not previously documented. We always tried to document on IRC things that would help us know who was doing what.
