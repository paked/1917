# Teamwork - by Harrison Shoebridge
While I was in a team I tried to help as much as possible. During the doomsday assignment, I helped my brain. During Mandelbrot I helped Julia[n]. During Game.c I helped Simon, Julia[n] and James.

In Mandelbrot I wrote a significant portion of the HTTP parts with routing while fixing bugs and writing a few colour algorithms. Julian took on the complex numbers things and we made quite a good team, whenever he had an issue he would ask me and whenever I had an issue I would ask him! We were able to fix all our issues and submit code on time.

-- HELPING STUFF --

In our pairwork I was originally teamed up with James. We worked well as a pair and our ability to work quickly while staying on top of due dates was awesome. I like to think that the code I wrote was some of the best I created in this course.

I am not the most sociable person ever when it comes to strangers, I find it hard to get out their sometimes... But I tried really hard to contribute to a discussion or help out someone struggling if I had a chance to.

-- RECENT ACTIVITY --

While I was working with teams we tried hard to plan how things would work and who would do what.

During the creating of Game we had a lot of situations where we would congratulate others on coming up with smart solutions to problems, or finding issues that we had not previously documented.
